Merchant analysis confirms this is a one-time restaurant charge, not a subscription, with high confidence in merchant identification.

Evidence suggests a likely authorized family member (Sophie Test-User) may have used the card, as her device was detected near the transaction location. The risk assessment flags high friendly fraud score based on recent dispute patterns, short account tenure, and low win rate, but with no fraud database entry. Manual review is recommended due to the combination of family member suspicion and high friendly fraud risk.",
